# DevSecOps Workshop Guide

This is the source for the guide for the DevSecOps workshop. The workshop is meant to provide
a hands-on introduction to modern adn secure application development and deployment workflows using OpenShift and technologies such as odo (OpenShift do), CodeReadyWorkspaces, Openshift Pipelines (Tekton), OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD) and security though Advanced Cluster Security (Stackrox). Our goal was explicitly to not have another demo but to provide a fun learning experience starting out with a blank OpenShift cluster. You will learn to build up this kind of professional environment by yourself.
