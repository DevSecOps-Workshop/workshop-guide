# DevSecOps Workshop Guide
This is the source for the guide to our DevSecOps workshop/experience day. The workshop is meant to provide 
a hands-on introduction to modern application development using OpenShift (Quarkus/odo/CRW/Tekton/GitOps) and 
securing with ACS. Our goal was explicitly to not have another demo but to provide a fun learning experience 
starting with a blank OpenShift cluster.

The markdown source lives in /content, this repo is rendered with the great Hugo static site generator automatically 
to https://devsecops-workshop.github.io/
