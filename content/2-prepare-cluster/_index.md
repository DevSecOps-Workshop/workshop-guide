## Cluster Preparation

Before you start you have to install a number of components you'll use during the workshop. The first two are `Gitea` for providing Git services in your cluster and **CodeReady Workspaces** as development environment. But fear not, both are managed by an [operator](https://cloud.redhat.com/learn/topics/operators).

## Install and Prepare Gitea
We'll need Git repository services to keep our app and infrastructure source code, so let's just install trusted `Gitea` using an operator:

{{% notice tip %}}
This is a good example of how you can integrate an operator into your catalog that is not part of the default [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/) already.
{{% /notice %}}

- Log in with the `oc` command to your OpenShift cluster (the easiest way is to use the **Copy login command** link when clicking on your username in the top right of the OCP Web Console).
- Now using `oc` add the Gitea Operator to your OpenShift OperatorHub catalog
```
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/gitea-operator/master/catalog_source.yaml
```
- In the Web Console, go to **Operators > OperatorHub** and search for `Gitea` (You may need to disable search filters)
- Install the `Gitea Operator` with default settings
- Create a new OpenShift project called `git`
- Go to **Installed Operators > Gitea Operator** and click on the **Create Instance** tile in the `git` project
- On the **Create Gitea** page switch to the YAML view and make sure the following `spec` values are set:

```
spec:
  giteaSsl: true
  giteaAdminUser: gitea
  giteaAdminPassword: "gitea"
  giteaAdminEmail: opentlc-mgr@redhat.com
```
- Click **Create**

After creation has finished:
- Access the route URL (you'll find it e.g. in **Networking > Routes > repository > Location**) 
- This will take you to the Gitea web UI
- Sign-In to `Gitea` with user `gitea` and password `gitea`
- Clone the example repo:
  - Click the **+** dropdown and choose **New Migration**
  - As type choose **Git**
  - **URL**: https://github.com/devsecops-workshop/quarkus-build-options.git
  - Click **Migrate Repository**

In the cloned repository you'll find a `devfile.yml`. We will need the URL to the file soon, so keep the tab open.

## Install and Prepare CodeReady Workspaces (CRW)
- Install the **Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces for Devfile v1 and v2** Operator from OperatorHub (not the Tech Preview one!) with default settings
- Go to **Installed Operators -> CodeReady Workspaces** and create a new instance (CodeReady Workspaces instance Specification) using the default settings in the project `openshift-workspaces`
- Wait until deployment has finished. This may take a couple of minutes as several components will be deployed. 
- Once the instance status is ready (You can check the YAML of the instance: `status > cheClusterRunning: Available`), look up the `codeready` Route in the `openshift-workspaces` namespace (You may need to toggle the **Show default project** button). 
- Open the link in a new browser tab, choose `htpasswd_provider` and log in with your OCP credentials
- Allow selected permissions
- Enter an email address, First Name and Last Name to set up your account (you can make these up).

{{% notice tip %}}
We could create a workspace from one of the templates that come with CodeReady Workspaces, but we want to use a customized workspace with some additionally defined plugins in a [v1 devfile](https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/) in our git repo. With devfiles you can share a complete workspace setup and with the click of a button you will end up in a fully configured project in your browser.       
{{% /notice %}}

- At the top click on **Custom Workspace**
- Copy the **raw**(!) URL of the `devfile.yml` file in your `Gitea` repository by clicking on the file and then on the **Raw** button (or **Originalversion** in German).
- Paste the full URL into the **Enter devfile URL** field and click **Load Devfile**
- Once the content of the devfile is loaded click on **Create & Open** at the button
- You'll get into the **Starting workspace ...** view, give the workspace containers some time to spin up.  

When your workspace has finally started, have a good look around in the UI. It should look familiar if you have ever worked with VSCode or similar IDEs.

{{% notice tip %}}
When working with CRW make sure you have AdBlockers disabled, you are not on a VPN and a have good internet connection to ensure a stable setup. If you are facing any issues try to releod the Browser window.  If that doesn't help restart the workspace in the controls on **yellow arrow** at the top left side

Your cluster is now prepared for the next step, proceed to the **Inner Loop**.
