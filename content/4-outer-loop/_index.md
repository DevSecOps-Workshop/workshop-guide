Now that you have seen how a developer can quickly start to code using modern cloud native tooling, it's time to learn how to proceed with the application towards production. The first step is to implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate new builds. Let's call this stage `int` for integration.

## Install OpenShift Pipelines

To create and run the build pipeline you'll use OpenShift Pipelines based on project Tekton. The first step is to install it:

- Install the `Red hat OpenShift Pipelines` Operator from OperatorHub with default settings
  {{% notice warning %}}
  Since the Piplines assets are installed asynchronously it is possible that the `Pipeline Templates` are not yet setup when proceeding immedately to the next step. So now is good time to grab a coffee.
  {{% /notice %}}

## Create App Deployment and Build Pipeline

After installing the Operator create a new deployment of your game-changing application:

- Create a new OpenShift project `workshop-int`
- Switch to the **OpenShift Developer Console**
- Click the **+Add** menu entry to the left and choose **Import from Git**
- As **Git Repo URL** enter the clone URL for the `quarkus-build-options` repo in your your `Gitea` instance (There might be a warning about the repo url that you can ignore)
- Click **Show advanced Git options** and for **Git reference** enter `master`
- As **Import Strategy** select `Builder Image`
- As **Builder Image** select `Java` and `openjdk-11-el7 / Red Hat OpenJDK 11 (RHEL 7)`
- As **Application Name** enter `workshop-app`
- As **Name** enter `workshop`
- Check **Add pipeline**

{{% notice warning %}}
If you don't have the checkbox **Add pipeline** and get the message `There are no pipeline templates available for Java and Deployment combination` in the next step then just give it few more minutes and reload the page.
{{% /notice %}}

- Click **Create**
- In the main menu left, click on **Pipelines** and observe how the Tekton Pipeline is created and run.

## Adjust the Pipeline to Deploy to Quay

The current Pipeline deploys to the internal Registry by default so the image that was created by the first (automatic) run was pushed there.

To leverage our brand new Quay registry we need to modify the Pipeline so it pushes images to the Quay registry. In addition the ImageStream must be modified to point to the Quay registry, too.

### Create a new `s2i-java` ClusterTask

The first thing is to create a new source-to-image Task to automatically update the **ImageStream** to point to Quay. You could of course copy and modify the default `s2i-java` task using the build-in YAML editor of the web console. But to make this as painless as possible we have prepared the needed YAML object definition for you already.

- Login to your bastion host via SSH, from here you can run `oc` commands
- Clone the Git repo with the YAML files you'll need: `git clone https://github.com/devsecops-workshop/yaml.git`
- Change into the `yaml` directory
- Apply the first YAML: `oc create -f s2i-java-workshop.yml`

{{% notice warning %}}
There is an issue with the delivered version of the Skopeo Clustertask, so we will also import an updated version. This may not be necessary in the future
Apply the YAML: `oc create -f skopeo-update.yml`
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}
You can do the above steps from any Linux system where you set up the `oc` command.
{{% /notice %}}

You should now have a new **ClusterTask** named `s2i-java-workshop`, go to the web console and check:

- Switch to the **Administrator** console
- Switch to the `workshop-int` Project
- Go to **Pipelines**->**Tasks**->**ClusterTasks**
- Search for the `s2i-java-workshop` ClusterTask and open it
- Switch to the YAML view

Please take the time to review the additions to the default `s2i-java` task:

- In the `params` section are two new parameters:

```yaml
- default: ''
    description: The name of the ImageStream which should be updated
    name: IMAGESTREAM
    type: string
- default: ''
    description: The Tag of the ImageStream which should be updated
    name: IMAGESTREAMTAG
    type: string
```

- At the end of the `steps` section is a new step:

```yaml
- env:
    - name: HOME
      value: /tekton/home
    image: 'image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/cli:latest'
    name: update-image-stream
    resources: {}
    script: >
      #!/usr/bin/env bash

      oc tag --source=docker $(params.IMAGE)
      $(params.IMAGESTREAM):$(params.IMAGESTREAMTAG) --insecure
    securityContext:
      runAsNonRoot: true
      runAsUser: 65532
```

### Modify the Pipeline

After adding the new task we need to modify the pipeline to:

- Introduce the new parameters into the Pipeline configuration
- Use the new `s2i-java-workshop` task

To make this easier we again provide you with a full YAML definition of the Pipeline. Do the following:

- Bring up the terminal and make sure you are in the `yaml` directory.

{{% notice tip %}}
If you use this lab guide with your domain as query parameter, you are good to go with the command, if not, you have to replace \<DOMAIN> manually in the following command.
{{% /notice %}}

- To replace the `DOMAIN` placeholder with your lab domain, run: `sed -i 's/DOMAIN/<DOMAIN>/g' workshop-pipeline-without-git-update.yml`
- Apply the new definition: `oc replace -f workshop-pipeline-without-git-update.yml`

Again take the time to review the changes in the web console:

- In the menu go to **Pipelines->Pipelines**
- Click the `workshop` Pipeline and switch to YAML
- These are the new parameters in the pipeline:

```yaml
- default: workshop
  name: IMAGESTREAM
  type: string
- default: latest
  name: IMAGESTREAMTAG
  type: string
```

- The preexisting parameter **IMAGE_NAME** now points to your local Quay registry:

```yaml
   - default: >-
        quay-quay-quay.apps.<DOMAIN>/openshift_workshop-int/workshop
      name: IMAGE_NAME
      type: string
```

And finally the `build` task was modified:

- The new parameters in the `params` section of the `build`:

```yaml
tasks:
    - name: build
      params:
        [...]
        - name: IMAGESTREAM
          value: $(params.IMAGESTREAM)
        - name: IMAGESTREAMTAG
          value: $(params.IMAGESTREAMTAG)
```

- The name of the `taskRef` was changed to `s2i-java-workshop`:

```yaml
taskRef:
  kind: ClusterTask
  name: s2i-java-workshop
```

You are done with adapting the Pipeline to use the Quay registry! Give it a try:

- First go to the Quay portal to the `openshift_workshop-int` organization.
- In the `openshift_workshop-int / workshop` repository access **Tags** in the menu to the left. There should be no image (yet).

Now it's time to configure and start the Pipeline. In the **Pipelines** view go to the top right menu and choose **Actions -> Start**. In the **Start Pipeline** window that opens, but **before** starting the actual pipeline we need to add a Secret so pipeline can authenticate and push against the Quay repo:

- Switch to the Quay Portal and click on the `openshift_workshop-int / workshop` repository
- On the left click on **Settings**
- Click on the `openshift_workshop-int+builder` Robot account and copy the username and token
- Back in the **Start Pipeline** form
  - At the buttom, click on **Show credential options** and then **Add secret**
  - Set these values
    - **Secret name** : `quay-workshop-int-token`
    - **Access to** : `Image Registry`
    - **Authentication type** : `Basic Authentication`
    - **Server URL** : `quay-quay-quay.apps.<DOMAIN>/openshift_workshop-int` (make sure to point to your cluster URL)
    - **Username** : `openshift_workshop-int+builder`
    - **Password or token** : the token you copied from the Quay robot account before ...
  - Then click on the checkmark below to add the secret
  - The secret has just been added and will be mounted automatically everytime the pipeline runs
- Hit **Start**

Once the Pipeline run has finished, go to the Quayportal again and check the **Repository** `openshift_workshop-int/workshop` again. Under **Tags** you should now see a new `workshop` Image version that was just pushed by the pipeline.

Congratulations : Quay is now a first level citizen of your pipeline build strategy.

## Create an ImageStream Tag with an Old Image Version

Now there your build pipeline has been set up and is ready. There is one more step in preparation of the security part of this workshop. We need a way to build and deploy from an older image with some security issues in it. For this we will add another ImageStream `Tag` in the default `Java` ImageStream that points to an older version with a known issue in it.

- Using the **Administrator** view, switch to the project `openshift` and under **Builds** click on the **ImageStreams**
- Search and open the **ImageStream** `java`
- Switch to YAML view and add the following snippet to the `spec > tags:` section.
  - Be careful to keep the needed indentation!

```yaml
- name: java-old-image
  annotations:
    description: Build and run Java applications using Maven and OpenJDK 8.
    iconClass: icon-rh-openjdk
    openshift.io/display-name: Red Hat OpenJDK 8 (UBI 8)
    sampleContextDir: undertow-servlet
    sampleRepo: "https://github.com/jboss-openshift/openshift-quickstarts"
    supports: "java:8,java"
    tags: "builder,java,openjdk"
    version: "8"
  from:
    kind: DockerImage
    name: "registry.redhat.io/openjdk/openjdk-11-rhel7:1.10-1"
  generation: 4
  importPolicy: {}
  referencePolicy:
    type: Local
```

This will add a tag `java-old-image` that points to an older version of the RHEL Java image. The image and security vulnerabilities can be inspected in the Red Hat Software Catalog [here](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/openjdk/openjdk-11-rhel7/5bf57185dd19c775cddc4ce5?tag=1.10-1&push_date=1629294893000&container-tabs=security)

- Have a look at version `1.10-1`

We will use this tag to test our security setup in a later chapter.

## Create a new Project

For the subsequent exercises we need a new project:

- Create a new OpenShift Project `workshop-prod`
