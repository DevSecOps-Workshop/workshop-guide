Now that you have seen how a developer can quickly start to code using modern tooling, it's time to learn how to proceed with the application towards production. The first step is to implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate new builds. Let's call this stage `int` for integration.

To create and run the build pipeline you'll use OpenShift Pipelines based on project Tekton. The first step is to install it:

- Install `OpenShift Pipelines` from OperatorHub

After this create a new deployment of your game-changing application:

- Create a new OpenShift project `workshop-int`
- Switch to the **OpenShift Developer Console**
- Click the **+Add** menu entry to the left and choose **Import from Git**
- As **Git Repo URL** enter your Gitea clone URL (There my may be warning about the repo url that you can ignore)
- As **Import Strategy** select **Builder Image**
- As **Builder Image** select **Java** and **Red Hat OpenJDK 11 (RHEL 7)**
- As **Application Name** enter **workshop-app**
- As **Name** enter **workshop** 
- Check **Add pipeline**
- Click **Create**
- In the main menu left, click on **Pipelines** and observe how the Tekton Pipeline is created adn run

Now your build pipeline has been set up and is ready. There is one more step in preparation of the security part of this workshop. We need a way to build and deploy from an older image with some security issues in it. For that we will add another **ImageStream Tag** in the default `Java` **ImageStream** that points to an older version.

- Using the Administrator view, switch to the project `openshift` and under **Builds** click on the **ImageStreams**
- Search and open the **ImageStream** `Java`
- Switch to YAML view and add the following snippet to the `tags:` section.
  - Be careful to keep the needed indentation!

```yaml
    - name: java-old-image
    annotations:
    description: Build and run Java applications using Maven and OpenJDK 8.
    iconClass: icon-rh-openjdk
    openshift.io/display-name: Red Hat OpenJDK 8 (UBI 8)
    sampleContextDir: undertow-servlet
    sampleRepo: 'https://github.com/jboss-openshift/openshift-quickstarts'
    supports: 'java:8,java'
    tags: 'builder,java,openjdk'
    version: '8'
  from:
    kind: DockerImage
    name: 'registry.redhat.io/openjdk/openjdk-11-rhel7:1.1-9'
  generation: 4
  importPolicy: {}
  referencePolicy:
  type: Local
```

This will add a tag `java-old-image` that points to an older version of the RHEL Java image. The image and security vulnerabilities can be inspected in the Red Hat Software Catalog here:
https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/openjdk/openjdk-11-rhel7/5bf57185dd19c775cddc4ce5?tag=1.10-1.1630314161&push_date=1630540002000&container-tabs=security
- Have a look at version `1.1-9`

Now run the pipeline again
- Open your `·∫Åorkshop` pipeline and choose **Start** from the pull down menu

Since we want to find a vulnerabiliy later in this workshop we will tell the pipeline to use a base image with the older version
- Edit the **VERSION** parameter and use `java-old-image` tag.
- Then click on **Start** to trigger the pipeline build

At the end of the pipeline in the deploy task, the application will be automatically deployed to the workshop-int project e.g for interation or user acceptance testing. Have a look in the **Developer Perspective** if you want.
