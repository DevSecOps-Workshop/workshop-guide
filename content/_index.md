# DevSecOps Workshop

## What is it about
This workshop will introduce you to the application development cycle leveraging [OpenShift's](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) tooling & features with a special focus on securing your environment using [Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (ACS)](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/advanced-cluster-security-kubernetes). 
You will get a brief introduction in several OpenShift features like [OpenShift Pipelines](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cicd/pipelines/op-release-notes.html), [OpenShift GitOps](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cicd/gitops/gitops-release-notes.html), [OpenShift CodeReadyWorkspaces](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview).
And all in a fun way.
