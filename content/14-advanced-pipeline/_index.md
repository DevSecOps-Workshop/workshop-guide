## Optimizing our DevSecOps Pipeline

In the chapter before we created a Pipeline which builds, checks and deploys our image, if the image passes all ACS checks. But what should happen, if the image doesn't pass the ACS check? It doesn't seems to be a good idea to save an unsafe image in the internal OpenShift registry. 
So lets modify our pipeline to an advanced one, which deletes an image, if it doesn't pass the ACS checks. 

### Prerequisites
There is a major security vulnerability in our code, but ACS is not able to detect it at the moment. So first of all navigate to ACS and follow these steps: 
- navigate to **Platform Configuration > System Policies**
- search for `Log4Shell` and click on it.
- go next until you are at the enforcement card and enable both `build` and `deploy` 
- save the policy

ACS is now able to detect the vulnerability. It is time now to implement your advanced Pipeline. 


### Let's go: Create our advanced Pipeline

In OpenShift administration view: 

- navigate to **Pipelines > Pipelines**
- on the left click **Create > Pipeline**
- switch to **YAML view**
- Replace the YAML displayed with this: 

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  labels:
  name: workshop-advanced
  namespace: workshop-int
spec:
  finally:
    - name: delete-image
      params:
        - name: SCRIPT
          value: 'oc tag -d workshop-int/workshop:dev -n workshop-int'
        - name: VERSION
          value: latest
      taskRef:
        kind: ClusterTask
        name: openshift-client
      when:
        - input: $(tasks.image-check.status)
          operator: in
          values:

      runAfter:

      taskRef:

        - name: image
          value: >-
            image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/workshop-int/workshop
        - name: image_digest
          value: $(tasks.build.results.IMAGE_DIGEST)
      runAfter:
        - build
      taskRef:
        kind: ClusterTask
        name: rox-image-check
    - name: tag-checked-image
      params:
        - name: SCRIPT
          value: 'oc tag workshop:dev workshop:latest'
        - name: VERSION
          value: latest
      runAfter:
        - image-check
      taskRef:
        kind: ClusterTask
        name: openshift-client
    - name: remove-dev-tag
      params:
        - name: SCRIPT
          value: 'oc tag -d workshop:dev'
        - name: VERSION
          value: latest
      runAfter:
        - image-check
      taskRef:
        kind: ClusterTask
        name: openshift-client
  workspaces:
    - name: workspace
```

Lets see what has changed in the Pipeline:

- the image which was built through the **build task** will be pushed in a new **ImageStreamTag** called `dev`
- if the image passes the ACS checks, the image will be pushed to the **ImageStreamTag** called `latest` and the `dev` tag will be removed
- if the image doesn't pass the ACS checks, the **ImageStreamTag** called `dev` will be removed. This is handled by a function called `finally` and a `when expression`
  - have a look at your Pipeline YAML and try to understand how it works
- the last three steps stays the same as before


### Test the advanced Pipeline

Go ahead and start your newly created advanced Pipeline. See what happens and play a little bit around with it. Have fun! 

#### Examples
Go to Gitea and remove the vulnerabilities and start the Pipeline again! 

{{% notice tip %}}
You have to remove them from `pom.xml` and `GreetingResource.java` in the `quarkus-build-options` repository!
